## Steps to Run the application

The application is live at https://main--quiet-buttercream-0cc937.netlify.app/

### Requirements
The testimonial API needs backend API. So, run the node server from your local machine by cloning from the below repo.

Repo link: https://github.com/suprxd/react-back

As the assigment didn't mention to host backend code, so the API is only accessible once local server is running.

Just clone the backend repo and do `npm run start`

and reload the netlify website.
